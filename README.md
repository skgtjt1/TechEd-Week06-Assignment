# Requirements

🎯 Create state variables to store the current number of cookies and the cookies PerSecond value (useState)

🎯 Set up a timer to increment the number of cookies by the cookiesPerSecond value (useEffect). Be sure to handle clearing the timer using the useEffect return value.

🎯 Set up an array of objects containing the items available for purchase in the store, their cost and their increment increase value. Map through these and create buttons for each.

🎯 Create a function to handle the purchase of an item. This should check if the user has enough cookies to purchase the item, and if so, subtract the cost of the item from the number of cookies and add the increment value to the cookiesPerSecond value.

# Stretch Goals

🏹 Store the cookies and cookiesPerSecond values in localStorage so they persist between page refreshes

💭 You can load saved values from localStorage as the default value passed to the useState hook

🏹 Retrieve data to populate your cookie upgrades from a third-party API using fetch and useEffect().
